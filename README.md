Free information exchange platform, implemented as location-based social network.

There are 2 major differences:
1. On the map you can see not only the places (and filter it by type), but also users and chat with the user, which is located now in a place interesting for you.
2. You can filter the feed. In the settings you can define regions of interest (near home, work, current location...), also filter by places types, language etc.

Current implementation includes:
Map with filter by types. It also shows user location.
Anyone can add a place. Registered user can claim ownership.
Posts can be connected to place.
Anyone can see the feed. Registered users can define regions of interest.
